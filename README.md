# Assignment Zero
## Reflections
I think this project was a good primer into C++. The basic requirements weren't particularly hard.
I am very concerned about the way I code though, because this is my first foray into C++. I dont know what is the recommended way to code anything so it would seem that I perform some "cowboy" style of coding where I just do what works. Would be nice if I could have a code review.
The bonuses were somewhat challenging, I wish I had more time to work on them but unfortunately I need to balance my time with other commitments.
Setup was a bit painful when I ran into driver issues on different computers.

## Working Environment
Windows 10, Nvidia GTX980, Visual Studio 2017 Community Edition.

## Working Exe files
You can find the working zero.exe file in the root folder of the project.

''' zero.exe < torus.obj '''

## Bonus Completed
- Rotation Function
- Smooth Color Transition Function
